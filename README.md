## UPDATE!!!
- After pondering, I decided to remove all mods that provide similar features to OptiFine, because these mods have reduced the modpack's performance, as well as compatibility with servers using custom resourcepacks.
- From now on, this modpack will prioritize game performance instead of supporting resourcepack features.
- [For AMD/Intel GPU users] Please disable/remove mod "Nvidium" for Fabric or "Acedium" for NeoForge if you don't want the game to crash due to incompatibility with your GPU, thank you for reading.

## Information
- Valkaw Client is a "Optimize Client for Fabric" designed for low-ends PC, forked from [Sliwed Optimize](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sliwed-optimize), ~~with many support features like OptiFine such as CEM, CTM,... Bringing you a better experience with resourcepack~~ with support from new mods, significantly increased and smoother performance.
- Version support: Fabric and NeoForge from 1.20.1 to latest version!!
