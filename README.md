- Valkaw Client is a "Optimize Client for Fabric" designed for low-ends PC, forked from [Sliwed Optimize](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sliwed-optimize), with many support features like OptiFine such as CEM, CTM,... Bringing you a better experience with resourcepack.
- Version support: Fabric 1.20x and higher!! (Maybe even 1.19x but this is quite tiring for me).
- Have a issue with this modpack? Click the "Issues" button on the modpack's Github page or join my Discord server for faster support.
# UPDATE!!!
- From now on, [Sliwed Optimize](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sliwed-optimize) will innovate and operate under a new name - Valkaw Client, this happened because I wanted to refresh the modpack with more than just a focus on performance.
- This modpack will support versions 1.20x and above, and I will update based on the number of mods updated for each game version.
