- Valkaw Client is a "Optimize Client for Fabric" designed for low-ends PC
- Forked from [Sliwed Optimize](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sliwed-optimize), with many support features like OptiFine such as CEM, CTM,... Bringing you a better experience with resourcepack :>
- Version support: Fabric 1.20x and higher!! (Maybe even 1.19x but this is quite tiring for me :/)
- Have a issue with this modpack? Click the "Issues" button on the modpack's Github page or join my Discord server for faster support :>
# UPDATE!!!
- From now on, [Sliwed Optimize](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sliwed-optimize) will innovate and operate under a new name - Valkaw Client
- This happened because I wanted to refresh the modpack with more than just a focus on performance :/
- This modpack will support versions 1.20x and higher (possibly backporting to 1.19x but this will be subject to cancellation)
